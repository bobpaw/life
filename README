# Life
`life` runs arbitrary cellular automata models based off of a rule integer.

To get a rule integer for a B/S rule string, use `rulestoint.py` with Python 3.

It runs with ncurses, so make sure to install it (usually with `apt-get install ncurses-base` or the equivalent with yum) and the dev version if you intend to build it yourself.
